This is a Python program that allows you to automatically adjust the pricing of your sneaker listings for two popular sneaker resell marketplaces - Restocks.net and Hypeboost.com. It allows you to retrieve all your current listings on both platforms and provides you with three options to manage your listings:

* Find and match the listing price to the current lowest market price of that sneaker
* Undercut the current lowest market price of that sneaker by 1 EUR
* Add a custom price to all listings

The program is completely request-based, and all listing updates, skips, and errors will be sent to a Discord webhook notification.
